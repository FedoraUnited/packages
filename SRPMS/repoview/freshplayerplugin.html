        <dt>Description:</dt>
        <dd><pre>As you know, Adobe have suspended further development of Flash player plugin
for GNU/Linux. Latest available as an NPAPI plugin version 11.2 will get
security updates for five years (since its release on May 4th, 2012), but
further development have been ceased.
Fortunately or not, newer versions are still available for Linux as a part of
Chrome browser, where Flash comes bundled in a form of PPAPI plugin. PPAPI or
Pepper Plugin API is an interface promoted by Chromium/Chrome team for browser
plugins.
It's NPAPI-inspired yet significantly different API which have every
conceivable function plugin may want. Two-dimensional graphics, OpenGL ES,
font rendering, network access, audio, and so on.
It's huge, there are 107 groups of functions, called interfaces which today's
Chromium browser offers to plugins.
And specs are not final yet. Interfaces are changing, newer versions are
arising, older ones are getting deleted. For various reasons Firefox
developers are not interested now in implementing PPAPI in Firefox.
However that does not mean it cannot be done.
The main goal of this project is to get PPAPI (Pepper) Flash player working
in Firefox. This can be done in two ways. First one is to implement full PPAPI
interface in Firefox itself.
Other one is to implement a wrapper, some kind of adapter which will look like
browser to PPAPI plugin and look like NPAPI plugin for browser.
First approach requires strong knowledge of Firefox internals,and moreover
additional effort to get the code into mainstream.
Maintaining a set of patches doesn't look like a good idea.
Second approach allows to concentrate on two APIs only.
Yes one of them is big, but still graspable.
Second way will be used for the project. It will benefit other browsers too,
not only Firefox.</pre></dd>
